# Day 2 / Tuesday

## Morning: Building and exploring a model of actin polymerization

Our goal will be (once we know a little about what actin is) to go from a mental model of how it works to a biophysical model we might be able to learn some things from. We'll be working in a Matlab live script, model_to_simulation.mlx

## Afternoon: Fitting models to actin polymerization data

Now that we've seen how our model behaves, we'll compare it with data. We'll work in fitting_to_data.mlx
