# MCSB Bootcamp Dry 2019

This repo is the home for MCSB bootcamp dry! It's organized into folders for the different modules.

# Please do the following before Day 1

* Install Git & other command line tools, Atom, Matlab. Instructions are in [Day 1 folder](/Day%201/README.MD).
* Make a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join) if you don't already have one

We'll ask you to install more stuff as well, but hold on until InstallFest at the end of day 1 for that.
