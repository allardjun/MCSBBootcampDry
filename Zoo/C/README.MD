# Rapid code evaluation with C

In order for a cell to interpret a signal from the outside world into a response involving gene expression, a molecule must diffuse from the cell's surface to a specific place on the nuclear surface, called a nuclear pore complex (NPC). We will simulate the time for NPC capture in C, Matlab and Julia.
