Figure 2: 8 controls
8
of 8
in the 8 system.
In panel A, we show the response of 8
, in units of 8
/8,
as 8 increases.
Several values of 8 are shown.
Using 8
allows us to infer 8
from observations of 8
in 8
In panel B, we compare the resulting estimations of 8
in units of 8
Data are shown for two conditions, 8 and 8
Overlaid curves are best fits of the 8 model
and the 8 model.
