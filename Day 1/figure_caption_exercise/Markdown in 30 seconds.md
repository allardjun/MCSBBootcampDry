# Markdown in 30 seconds

Markdown is an easily readable text formatting language meant for being translated into HTML.
Mostly you can just type.
Text on sequential lines will flow together when rendered.
Use an empty line to get a new paragraph.

Markdown can render links, images and tables.

In Atom, hit `ctrl`+`shift`+`m` to see rendered output.

If you want to know how to do more, check out the raw versions of the markdown files throughout this repo.
There should be examples of just about everything.
