# Day 1 / Monday

## Before Monday

To get started you need to install Git, some command line tools, Atom (a text editor) and Matlab. Follow the instructions below. 

### Coding Tools Installation Instructions

We'll be using git from the command line and through the Atom text editor.

#### Git and command line tools

MacOS:
1. Open terminal
1. `xcode-select --install`

Windows 10:
1. Control Panel -> Turn Windows features on and off -> enable "Windows subsystem for Linux"
1. Reboot
1. Windows Store -> search “Ubuntu” -> Install
1. Set up Ubuntu
  1. Open the command line
  1. `sudo apt update`
  1. `sudo apt install build-essential`
1. Go to a location Windows can see: `cd /mnt/c`

Ubuntu: All the tools we need are part of build-essential. Follow instruction under step 4 above to install it.

Other operating systems: You're on your own. We will be using Git from the command line.

You should now be able to enter `git --version` and have it return something like "git version 2.17.1". The version won't matter for what we're doing today.

#### Atom

### Matlab Install Instructions

UCI provides Matlab to students for free. To download and install it, follow the instructions here: http://laptops.eng.uci.edu/software-installation/matlab


## Day 1 Morning: Science, project management and Git

The goal of this morning is to discuss how to manage a project as a graduate student, focusing on an example of managing a coding project with Git.

### Lecture and project

The lecture on git and project instructions are in [git-lecture.md](git-lecture.md)

## Day 1 Afternoon: A sample project and Matlab basics

In the afternoon, we'll apply our new knowledge of git to set up a computational project. We'll write the code for this project in Matlab.
