\section*{Project 5: Discrete logistic growth}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 
Suppose a perennial plant has a population $x(n)$ at year $n$, where $x$ is measured in thousands. If the population were growing in an unbounded environment, the population obeys
\begin{equation}
x(n+1) = x(n) + r \cdot x(n)
\end{equation} 
where $r$ is the per-capita growth rate. If instead the population is in a bounded environment, growth is limited, and the population obeys
\begin{equation}
x(n+1) = x(n) + r \left( 1- \frac{x(n)}{K}\right) x(n)
\end{equation} 
where $K$ is a parameter we refer to as the carrying capacity. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Suppose $r=0.1$ and $K=0.6$.  Sketch your intuition for the population $x(t)$ from a starting population $x(0)=0.2$. What are the steady states? Which are stable, and which are unstable?
\end{enumerate}

Write Matlab code to solve the dynamical system, and answer the following questions:
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Suppose $r=0.1$ and $K=0.6$. Generate time series of the populations for a few starting populations~$x(0)$. Does it match your intuition?
\item Suppose $r=2.1$ and $K=0.6$. Generate time series of the populations for a few starting populations~$x(0)$. 
\end{enumerate}
In a discrete-time dynamical system, if the population cycles between two values, the solution is called a two-cycle. Cycling between $N$ values is called an $N$-cycle. 
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\item Check that at $r=2.5$ and $K=0.6$ there is a 4-cycle. Can you find a 3-cycle?
\item In this part, we will do a parameter sweep for $0<r<3.0$, with fixed $K=0.6$. The goal is to generate a diagram where the horizontal axis is the parameter value $r$. On the vertical axis, if there is a stable steady state, plot the steady-state population. If there is an $N$-cycle, plot the $N$ values of $x$ that it cycles through. \footnote{This type of behavior in a dynamical system is called \emph{chaos}! This particular type of chaos is called period-doubling chaos.}
\begin{itemize}
\item Hint: One way to plot the steady state or the $N$-cycle is to simulate the system until $n_{\rm max}$, and plot the last half values of $x(n)$. You need to choose $n_{\rm max}$ large enough so that the dynamics have settled into their steady state (or steady cycle) by $n_{\rm max}/2$.
\item Hint: How many $r$ values should you explore? 
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

In this problem, we ask, if the axon is subject to a force, which mechanical element ``takes a bigger hit"?
